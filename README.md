# ClashRoyaleInfo

This is a Discord bot that gets data from the official Clash Royale api.

## TODO
- [x] Finish all the translations
- [ ] Add a 'Season' command.
- [X] Move clantag to database
- [ ] Commands listing a certain amount of people must check if those members are in the clan [#4](/../../issues/4#issuecomment-656353194)

I will make registering and the clan commands available to everyone, regardless of the clan you're in<br />
