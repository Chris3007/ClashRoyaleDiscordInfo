# ClashRoyaleInfo

This is a Discord bot that gets data from the official Clash Royale api.


## TODO
- [ ] Finish all the translations
- [ ] Add a 'Season' command.
- [X] Move clantag to database
- [ ] Commands listing a certain amount of people must check if those members are in the clan

Maybe, when the above points are finished, I will make registering and the clan commands available to everyone, regardless of the clan you're in<br />
<hr />

In this branch I will translate everything to English. Any new files will be written in English too.
